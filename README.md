This was my initial prompt.
> Make a Javascript app for "Breaking Bad" spelling using the abbreviations of the chemical elements.
At the top is a place to enter a word or a name. If the word can't be spelled with element abbreviations, give the message "No spelling possible". But if it can, use a tumbling animation effect to bring in squares with the element information on them. The squares will fit together to spell the target name.
